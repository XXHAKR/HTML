Fan death 
    </strong>

    <h2>
            It is alleged that fans may cause asphyxiation by oxygen displacement and carbon dioxide intoxication.
             In the process of human respiration, inhaled fresh air is exhaled with a lower concentration of oxygen gas (O2) and higher concentration of carbon dioxide gas (CO2), causing a gradual reduction of O2 and buildup of CO2 in a completely unventilated room.
    </h2>

    <p>
        Where the idea came from is unclear, but fears about electric fans date back to their introduction to Korea, with stories dating to the 1920s and 1930s warning of the risks of nausea, asphyxiation, and facial paralysis from the new technology.

    <p>
        One conspiracy theory is that the South Korean government created or perpetuated the myth as propaganda to curb the energy consumption of South Korean households during the 1970s energy crisis, but Slate reports that the myth is much older than that â€“ probably as far back as the introduction of electric fans in Korea, and cites a 1927 article about "Strange Harm from Electric Fans".

    <h3>
        Asphyxiation is the alleged death of humans as a result of running an electric fan in a closed room with unopened or no windows. While no reliable evidence supports the existence of fan death, belief in fan death persisted to the mid 2000s in South Korea, and also to a lesser extent in Japan.

    <b>
        The Korea Consumer Protection Board (KCPB), a South Korean government-funded public agency, issued a consumer safety alert in 2006 warning that "asphyxiation from electric fans and air conditioners" was among South Korea's five most common summer accidents or injuries, according to data they collected.
